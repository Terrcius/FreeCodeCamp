Like yesterday, just reviewing some things from CSS, uploaded a Cafe Menu that most of it was made in CSS, I'am really excited to see some more things,
the sintaxe and comments in the code is messy but understandable, I need to focus more in good pratics to have a more clean code.

I learned a lot of specific things today, some i know i will never use, but is always good to learn something new, i need to see some of the things working
in diferents situations, just that for today (Registration Forms).

Most of my week i was studying for tests that is why there is good gap of days in the platform, anyway in the ColoredMarkers was just a review of basic things
I think that this first part is just realy basic stuff so I'm doing just for the certification.
